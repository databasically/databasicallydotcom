<h4><a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/" target="_blank">RubyMotion</a></h4>

<h4><a href="http://intridea.com/blog/2012/5/24/building-streaming-rest-apis-with-ruby" target="_blank">Building Streaming REST APIs with Ruby</a></h4>
<p><blockquote>Streaming APIs are great for pushing data from the backend to clients. They reduce resource usage because the server can decide when it's a good time to send a incremental chunk of data. They can also improve the responsiveness of your user experience. The same HTTP API can be reused to power multiple different apps.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>Low level caching is very easy to get started with in Rails 3, but it seems to be missing from the official guides.<br><br>Why should you use low level caching, and what should you use it for? Maybe you have some data which you need regularly over multiple pages, e.g. a list of categories for your blog. You might want to display them on every page but theyâ€™re not going to need to be entirely up to date for every request.</blockquote>
