During an app upgrade to Rails 2.2.2, I came across this error that baffled me for a few minutes:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">ActionView::TemplateError
    (wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)) on line #34
    of app/views/account/_dashboard_header.rhtml:

34: &lt;%= link_to 'My Dashboard', my_dashboard_url &gt;</pre>

Checking out the backtrace:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">(eval):3:in `default_url_options'
(eval):3:in `my_dashboard_url'
app/views/account/_dashboard_header.rhtml:34</pre>

Confusing.  Why would this named route suddenly stop working?  I did a search for default_url_options and found that I had overridden that function:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">if production_mode?
  def default_url_options()
    { :protocol =&gt; 'https://' }
  end
end</pre>
Aha!  Back in the day, default_url_options didn't have any default options, so I wasn't bothering to merge my desired options with the options parameter.  I fixed it with a <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/CoreExtensions/Hash/ReverseMerge.html">reverse_merge</a> so any passed-in options would still exist.
