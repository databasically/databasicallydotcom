Using rvm 1.16.3 to install ruby 1.9.3-p286 and received this error my Ubuntu (9.04) server:

<pre name="code" class="ruby">It seems your ruby installation is missing psych (for YAML output). 
To eliminate this warning, please install libyaml and reinstall your ruby.
</pre>

I had to install libtool first:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">sudo apt-get install libtool</pre>

Then install libyaml via RVM:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">rvm pkg install libyaml</pre>

Then reinstalled Ruby with:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">rvm reinstall all --force</pre>
