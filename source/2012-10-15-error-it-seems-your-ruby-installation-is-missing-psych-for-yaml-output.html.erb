Using rvm 1.16.3 to install ruby 1.9.3-p286 and received this error my Ubuntu (9.04) server:

<% code("ruby") do %>It seems your ruby installation is missing psych (for YAML output). 
To eliminate this warning, please install libyaml and reinstall your ruby.
<% end %>

I had to install libtool first:
<% code("ruby") do %>sudo apt-get install libtool<% end %>

Then install libyaml via RVM:
<% code("ruby") do %>rvm pkg install libyaml<% end %>

Then reinstalled Ruby with:
<% code("ruby") do %>rvm reinstall all --force<% end %>
