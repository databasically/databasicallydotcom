Every month, <a href="http://meetup.com/kcruby">Kansas City Ruby</a> (#kcruby) reviews a subset of Peter Cooper's fantastic <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/?utm_source=databasically">Ruby Weekly</a> selections, along with other items picked up around the web.

<blockquote>There is a trivially exploitable remote code execution vulnerability in all versions of rails. The vulnerability is related to the XmlMini xml parser used by the rails ParamsParser which prepares the "params" object for ActionController.

By supplying YAML contents parsed via XML elements using "type=yaml" attackers can instantiate arbitrary objects in the rails runtime which can be exploited through core rails and application-defined method calls. Several exploitable conditions have been confirmed, the worst of which result in RCE via shell commands in the underlying system.</blockquote>
