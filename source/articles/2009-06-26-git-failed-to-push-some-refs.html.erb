title: ! 'git: failed to push some refs'

I'm really digging git, but its error messages are less than helpful at times.
<br><br>
<% code("ruby") do %>git push origin master
error: failed to push some refs to origin<% end %>
<br><br>
Most likely, there are changes in the remote repo that you need to pull first:
<% code("ruby") do %>git pull origin master<% end %>
<br><br>
Resolve any conflicts, then you can push to the remote git repo.
<br><br>
I'm not sure why "failed to push some refs" couldn't include "(do you need to pull?)"
