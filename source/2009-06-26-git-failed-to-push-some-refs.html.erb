I'm really digging git, but its error messages are less than helpful at times.

<pre class="ruby" name="code">git push origin master
error: failed to push some refs to origin</pre>

Most likely, there are changes in the remote repo that you need to pull first:
<pre class="ruby" name="code">git pull origin master</pre>

Resolve any conflicts, then you can push to the remote git repo.

I'm not sure why "failed to push some refs" couldn't include "(do you need to pull?)"
