-#       %p You don't want to have to worry about the ability of your software -# developers, so we tell you when we are pushing the boundaries of our -# abilities. It doesn't happen that often.

-#       %p Most developers will just build whatever you tell them to build. We -# make it a habit to tell you what not to build so we can figure out what -# will make the biggest difference for your business. Our customers love it.

-#       %h3 Design
-#       %p We will take your requirements and translate them into a system -# architecture and a set of user stories and views. If you have a designer -# that you like to work with, we are ok with that too.

-#       %p This is where our strength really starts to shine. We write code that -# is easy to maintain so you spend less money over the lifetime of your -# project.
-#       %h3 Deploy
-#       %p We put new code on the server early and often, that way you can play around with it and so we can work together to discover new requirements.
