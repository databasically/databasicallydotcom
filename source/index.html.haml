      %h4 Technical partners
      %p You don't want to have to worry about the ability of your software developers, so we tell you when we are pushing the boundaries of our abilities. It doesn't happen that often.

      %img{:alt => "", :src => "http://lorempixel.com/g/350/250/technics?2"}/
      %h4 User focus
      %p Most developers will just build whatever you tell them to build. We make it a habit to tell you not to build things so we can figure out what will make the biggest difference for your business. Our customers love it.

        %a{:href => "meetup.com/kcruby"} KC Ruby meetup

      %h3 Discover
      %p We work quickly to figure out your objectives and requirements so you get the business result you want without having to worry.
      %h3 Design
      %p We will take your requirements and translate them into a system architecture and a set of user stories and views. If you have a designer that you like to work with, we are ok with that too.
      %h3 Develop
      %p This is where our strength really starts to shine. We write code that is easy to maintain so you spend less money over the lifetime of your project.
      %h3 Deploy
      %p We put new code on the server early and often, that way you can play around with it and so we can work together to discover new requirements.
