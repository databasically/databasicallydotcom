Oftentimes, I don't need every single email saved into the log file.  When I'm developing, they get in the way. In a production environment, they take up a lot of room make the log harder to read.

So, I normally put this in my environment.rb:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">ActionMailer::Base.logger = nil</pre>
