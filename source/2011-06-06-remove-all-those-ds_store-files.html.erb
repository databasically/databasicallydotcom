I don't like committing .DS_Store files into my projects, so here's an easy way to remove them:

Run this from your project folder:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">
# Recursively erase all .DS_Store files in this folder and below
find . -name \.DS_Store -exec rm -v {} \;
</pre>

Also, you can prevent the DS_Store files from being created.  Run this from the Terminal:
<pre name="code" class="ruby">
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true
</pre>
