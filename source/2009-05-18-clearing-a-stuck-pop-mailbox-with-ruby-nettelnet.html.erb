title: Clearing a stuck POP mailbox with Ruby Net::Telnet
post_date: 2009-05-18

A client's mailbox was full. Outlook tried to download all messages before deleting them, and I don't know a setting to make it retrieve/delete a set number.

So, knowing that you can telnet to a POP server, I wrote up a little ruby script to delete the first 1000 messages without bothering to retrieve them.
<% code("ruby") do %>require 'net/telnet'

pop = Net::Telnet::new("Host" =&gt; "pop.server.com",
  "Port" =&gt; 110,
  "Telnetmode" =&gt; false,
  "Timeout"    =&gt; false,
  "Prompt" =&gt; /^\+OK/n)
pop.cmd("user " + "name@domain.com") { |c| print c }
pop.cmd("pass " + "P@ssword") { |c| print c }
pop.cmd("stat") { |c| print c }
1.upto(1000) do |i|
  pop.cmd("dele #{i}")
  puts i if 0 == i % 100
end
pop.cmd("stat") { |c| print c }

pop.cmd("quit") { |c| print c }<% end %>
Here's the output:
<% code("ruby") do %>+OK hello from popgate 2.43 on pop.server.com
+OK password required.
+OK maildrop ready, 50139 messages (1474122084 octets) (1477758478)
100
200
300
400
500
600
700
800
900
1000
+OK message 1000 marked deleted
+OK 49139 1462508238<% end %>
I put the STAT lines in there so I could see how many messages were there at the start and finish of the script running.

The Ruby POP3 library has a delete_all(), but the last day or so of mail hadn't been retrieved at all, so I couldn't just nuke the mailbox and start over.  I only needed to clear some space so that I could connect normally (and set the client to delete-on-retrieve).  You could mimic that by parsing the STAT response for the number of messages. I leave that as an exercise to the reader.

I made some more tweaks after writing this post and added support for growl:
<% code("ruby") do %>system "growlnotify -m '#{i} of 1000 deleted'
 -d popdelete" if 0 == i % 25<% end %>
That way I could just watch the growl window in the corner to see how it was doing.  The <i>-d</i> flag groups the notifications so that I didn't get a separate notification window for each message; the new message updates the previous notification window.

When I was searching for a solution before writing my own, I looked for "pop delete all" and "pop clear" and "pop commands" and "pop command delete all".  Hope that helps someone else find this article.
