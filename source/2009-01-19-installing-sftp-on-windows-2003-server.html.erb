I needed to set up a quick FTP server on a Windows server.  I don't like opening FTP ports if I can help it, so I wanted to find a easy SFTP server.  This one is great and super easy to set up:

<a href="http://www.coreftp.com/server/   ">http://www.coreftp.com/server/
</a>

You give it a username and password and a directory where the user should end up. Simple, but effective.
