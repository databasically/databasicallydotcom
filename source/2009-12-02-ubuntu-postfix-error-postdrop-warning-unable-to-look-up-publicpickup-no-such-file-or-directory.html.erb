I installed postfix and got this error:
<code>postdrop: warning: unable to look up public/pickup: No such file or directory.</code>
<!--more-->
Turns out that sendmail was previously installed and that was messing things up.  I had to stop sendmail and make the appropriate directory and restart postfix.

Specifically:
<code>
mkfifo /var/spool/postfix/public/pickup
ps aux | grep mail
kill <sendmail process id>
sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart
</sendmail></code>
