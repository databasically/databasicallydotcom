This isn't specific to capistrano, necessarily, but I ran into it deploying.

<code>fatal: unable to create '.git/index.lock': File exists</code>
<!--more-->
The fix:
Got to your project's shared/cached-copy/.git folder and delete index.lock .  It shouldn't ever get hung up like that, but it happened to me.
