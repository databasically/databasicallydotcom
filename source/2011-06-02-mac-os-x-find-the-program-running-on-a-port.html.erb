Sometimes, there's a program running on a port and you don't know what it is.  How do you find out?

<!--more-->

I find this happens when I start a webserver up to test something locally and then I forget about it.  So, if I wanted to find out what was running on port 80:
<pre class="ruby">  sudo lsof -i :80 # checks port 80

  COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE    DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
  ruby    64888   wg    6u  IPv4 0x6ddd270      0t0  TCP *:gds_db (LISTEN)</pre>
&nbsp;

This command shows a list of open files. The -i option checks for internet addresses with the colon symbol representing a port (instead of an actual IP address).  Note, I've only used this on Mac OS X.  I'm not sure if there's an equivalent for *nix or if it's available in some package.
