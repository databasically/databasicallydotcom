I never can remember how to do this from the command line and the docs are just hazy enough to be a pain:
<pre>&gt; mysqladmin -u root -p password &lt;ENTER_NEW_PASSWORD&gt;</pre>
And yes, that is "space-p-a-s-s-w-o-r-d" after the -p.  Sending that tells mysql that you want to change the password to whatever is next.  You'll be prompted for the existing/old password:
<pre>Enter password: ********</pre>
