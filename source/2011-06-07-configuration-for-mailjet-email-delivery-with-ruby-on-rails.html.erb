<p>Setting up mailjet.com to deliver your mail via Ruby on Rails?  Here's how, because their <a href="https://www.mailjet.com/docs/getting_started">Getting Started</a> is nothing but placeholder headers right now.<br>

</p><!--more--><h2>Create an account</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.mailjet.com">https://www.mailjet.com</a> and create an account.</p>
<p>Note: the word "Faculatative" means "optional" on the signup form.</p>

<h2>Add your sending address</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a sending address (Accounts > <a href="https://www.mailjet.com/account/sender">Sender Addresses</a>)</li>
<li>Update your Rails ActionMailer configuration
<ul><li>Find the settings you need at: <a href="https://www.mailjet.com/account/setup">https://www.mailjet.com/account/setup</a><br>
  <pre>
    SMTP server:
    in.mailjet.com

    Username (API Key):
    12345678901234567890

    Password (Secret Key):
    99999999999999999999999999999999

    Port:
    25 or 587 (some providers block port 25)

    Use TLS:
    yes
  </pre></li>
  <li>Set these settings in config/application.rb (or config/environments/production.rb):
  <% code('ruby') do %>

    config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false
    config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true

    config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
      :address => "in.mailjet.com",
      :enable_starttls_auto => true,
      :port => 587,
      :authentication => 'plain',
      :user_name => "12345678901234567890",
      :password => "99999999999999999999999999999999"
    }

  </pre>
  </li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup domain authentication (SPF and/or DomainKeys/DKIM)</h2>
<h3>SPF</h3>
<p>
  <img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110607-nmn91j4ukdp8yna3pup3qu1sb8.png" alt="My Account - mailjet.com" /><br>
  Click <b>Domain DNS and SMTP setup</b>.<br>
  Then, under <b>Domain Authentication</b>, click your domain.
</p><p>Setting up SPF requires adding a DNS entry. Mailjet will look at your existing one and give you the one to replace it with.
  It'll look something like: <br><code>domainname.com.	IN TXT "v=spf1 include:spf.mailjet.com mx ~all"</code><br>
  In my DNS manager, I created a TXT record, gave it a name of "domainname.com." and set the value to the <br><code>'v=spf1 include:spf.mailjet.com mx ~all'</code> portion (without the quotes).  The full example they give you is for the DNS zone syntax, which you may or may not have.<br><br>

  If you need help configuring this, <a href="/contact-us">we would be happy to help you</a>.</p>
  <h3>DKIM</h3>
  <p>
  This is similar, a TXT record that has a key that identifies your server so mail can be sent.  Same deal.
</p>

<h2>Test</h2>
<p>Deploy your changes and kick off something that sends a mailer.  We have a Notifier model that has a <code>test_email()</code> method that I just called from the console to push a test through.  I just went to the reports and saw it there.</p>
<p>All in all, the service seems a little rough around the edges, mostly due to it being a French company that could use a little work on the translations and some serious love on the support documentations.  Hope this helps you get started with Mailjet configuration!</p>
