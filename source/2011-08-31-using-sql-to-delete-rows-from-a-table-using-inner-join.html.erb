Oftentimes, one wants to delete some records from a table based on criteria in another table. How do you delete from one of those tables without removing the records in both table?
<pre class="ruby" name="code">DELETE DeletingFromTable
 FROM DeletingFromTable INNER JOIN CriteriaTable
 ON DeletingFromTable.field_id = CriteriaTable.id
 WHERE CriteriaTable.criteria = "value";</pre>
The key is that you specify <strong>the name of the table to be deleted</strong> from as the <strong>SELECT</strong>. So, the JOIN and WHERE do the selection and limiting, while the DELETE does the deleting.

You're not limited to just one table, though. If you have a many-to-many relationship (for instance, Magazines and Subscribers, joined by a Subscription) and you're removing a Subscriber, you need to remove any potential records from the join model as well.

<pre class="ruby" name="code">
DELETE subscribers, subscriptions
 FROM subscribers INNER JOIN subscriptions 
   ON subscribers.id = subscriptions.subscriber_id
 INNER JOIN magazines 
   ON subscriptions.magazine_id = magazines.id
 WHERE subscribers.name='Wes';
</pre>

Deleting records with a join could also be done with a LEFT JOIN and a WHERE to see if the joined table was NULL, so that you could remove records in one table that didn't have a match (like in preparation for adding a relationship.)  Example post to come.
