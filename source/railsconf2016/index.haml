%h2 Events Surrounding Railsconf 2016

%p
  Hi! If you're coming to Railsconf 2016 in Kansas City and you're arriving a day early or late, this is the place to find something to do.

%h3 Who are you?
%p
  My name is Wes Garrison. I grew up in Kansas City and I want you to see something other than the inside of a conference center. So, I'll be coordinating a lot of different events so you can see the sights. Plus, new Ruby Friends are always great!

%h3 How does this work?

%ul
  %li
    Follow
    = link_to '@wesgarrison', 'https://twitter.com/wesgarrison'
    for more timely updates as we get closer.
  %li Look at the events below.
  %li
    Send suggestions to
    = link_to '@wesgarrison', 'https://twitter.com/wesgarrison'
  %li For popular events, I'll send out specific arrangements, ticket details, and transportation plans.
  %li For general attractions, I'll help coordinate and connect interested parties.

Events with specific times and/or reservation requirements are first.

General attractions are

We don't have specific times that we need to be at these, but let me know you're interested!
