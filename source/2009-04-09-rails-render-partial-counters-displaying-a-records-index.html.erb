I always forget that you can reference the index of an item in a collection when you're using a partial:
<% code("ruby") do %>&lt;%= render :partial => 'item', :object => @items %>
# in _item.html.erb
&lt;%= item_counter %><% end %>
This is zero-based, so you might want to +1 if you want the count to start at 1.

It's an easy way to number lines in a partial, which I find I do fairly often and I can never remember the syntax for getting that index counter!
