            <h1>Amazing software</h1>
            <p>Changing the world, one line of code at a time</p>
          </div>
          <div class="well">
            <h3>Why we love what we do</h3>
            <p>Software has the power to transform the way we live. It is limited only by our imaginations. Software and the internet once promised us all a better world, where life would be better, easier, and happier. We belive in this promise, and we work to make it a reality, one client at a time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="well">
            <h3>Web application experts</h3>
            <p>Lots of companies will tell you they can scale Rails, but we have done it. Our largest production web application is currently serving millions of records in live data.
            Our first Rails application was built in a beta release over 6 years ago, and the clients have been so happy with our work that we continue to actively develop that application today. Given our extensive experience, we prefer to use Ruby on Rails when we have a choice.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="well">
            <h3>Our process</h3>
            <p>We have used lots of processes and are comfortable with them, but what really matters is that we use the processes that will create the best result for you, our client. We will work closely with you to determine what your business objectives are for your current stage of development, and then tailor processes that will give you maximum return for your money.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="well">
            <h3>Professionals</h3>
            <p>Have you ever worked with a developer that had a hard time meeting their commitments? We are organized and hard working midwestern people. Our region is rooted in rural farming, where people work by the sun’s clock or they don’t deliver any crops. Our philosophy is to work hard every day and to treat your needs like the sunlight, so you always know that you can count on us.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="well">
            <h3>Start small guarantee</h3>
            <p>When you trust someone to build your vision, it's critical that you find someone that is a good partner. To make sure that we are a good fit for you, we prefer to start with a small project. This allows you to assess our code quality, process, and commitment first hand. And if we do a small project for you and you think we didn’t provide value for your money, we will give you a full refund.</p>
