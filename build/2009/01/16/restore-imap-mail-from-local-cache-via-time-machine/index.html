        I had a real scary moment last night.  I was cleaning off my server and deleted the home directory for my databasically email account. I don't host the website on that server, so I thought removing the home directory would be fine.  However, I do host the mail on that server and it's stored in the home directory.
        <br><br>
        I had Apple Mail.app running and connected to that mailbox.  I didn't really notice it until a few minutes later when a message came in on another account.
        <br><br>
        My work account was blank.  Empty. Also, I had a nice exclamation point saying the account couldn't be found.
        <br><br>
        Whoops.  Oh hell.
        <br><br>
        I have my computer hooked to an external hard drive which I'm using as my Time Machine (the built-in Mac backup software) drive.  I poked through the folders from an hour ago and found all my mail.
        <br><br>
        The mail is stored in ~/Library/Mail/, where each IMAP account has a folder called <strong>IMAP-user@host</strong>. This folder contains many folders with the .imapmbox extension.
        <br><br>
        Here's how I restored my mailbox:
        <ul>
        	<li>Recreated my home directory and made sure that the email address still worked.  You may want to set up a new account if you're moving hosts or whatever.  Get a working IMAP account up and running.</li>
        	<li>Put the IMAP-user@host folder to my Desktop.  Actually, I restored it from Time Machine and then copied it to the Desktop. I selected "Keep both" when doing the Time Machine restore which renamed my existing folder to end in "(original)".  I moved the restored folder to my Desktop and removed the "(original)".</li>
        	<li>Renamed each folders' extension from <strong>.imapmbox</strong> to <strong>.mbox</strong> . Make sure you get any subfolders as well.</li>
        	<li>Import the file:  File &gt; Import Mailboxes &gt; Mail for Mac OS X</li>
        	<li>Select the parent folder (IMAP-user@host) containing all your .mbox files.</li>
        	<li>Your mail will be imported to a folder named <strong>Import</strong> inside the On My Mac folder.</li>
        	<li>Drag your mail to your new/restored IMAP mailbox.  I copied 5000 messages at a time without an issue.</li>
        </ul>
        Hopefully you never need this information.
